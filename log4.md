start date: September 23, 2021, prospective end date: January 1, 2022

### 15 Oct 19
- finished up the speller problem and submitted it, will wait for the written explanation unless i need it, still antsy for python lecture saving for tomorrow

### 14 Oct 18
- took a bit of time for a brain break and adjusted the numbering here.. it'll be a bit wonky for a bit. worked a bit more on speller and reference materials to finish up the problem, goal is to finally finish it all up tomorrow  and then python üêç!

### 13 Oct 12
- i recall with 'filter' I realized there was a playlist of videos to walk through much too late to refer to, but now focusing solely on the walk through and taking down comments and notes, I feel a tiny bit more confident I know what is going on. at least now i know where to refer to older lecture notes to reference and can google other gaps like usual. barely started on the first of five functions; I have a feeling the first is the longest/most difficult

### 12 Oct 11
- started breaking down the explanation of the problem into a different word doc to understand the process, it was a very long description, hints and notes and my skimming doesnt always catch the details! code time tomorrow

### 11: Oct 10
- haphazardly and quickly wrote out the week 3 and 4 recaps and published! Back to speller problem set tomorrow

### 10: Oct 7
- got to put a bit more time and understanding for lab 5 to write out an attempt, work through and note down. I see why they're much easier with walk throughs and pseudocode but nice to see this week only has one pset, it's probably another long doozy like filter. it's queued up for tomorrow (or saturday) to start piecing together

### 9: Oct 5
- leaving the recap blog posts for the weekend to write up.. and backdate. watched lecture 5 on data structures, going to review course notes once more tomorrow and start the week lab

### 8: Oct 3
- started the notebook written explanation and leaving week 5 lecture for tomorrow, i'm sure it's goin to be info heavy again..

### 7: Oct 2
- walked through an explanation after getting the problem start and did the checks for recover, no issues!

### 6: Sept 29
- started recovery problem set and noticed the programs you have to write out most all yourself seem much easier to get started, or the walkthroughs are more helpful, ha! also, bits and pieces of lecture notes code help get started on this one as well

### 5: Sept 28
- wrote out the last bit of the blur function explanation, some bits still kind of missing but will circle back, I got most of it...onto 'recover,' hopefully a tiny bit easier üòÖ

### 4: Sept 26
- pretty short day since being out for most of it for once! writing out the last bit of explanations (mostly) and getting set up for the next pset, just want to be done with week 4 then struggle through week 5! :P

### 3: Sept 25
- wrote out the last bit of the functions and started writing out the walkthroughs in my notebook, stuck at blur again in that way. for these problems stuck in C, I'm more concerned with seeing how others did it and explain the basics to myself since I'm quite sure I won't be writing this type of code to start off with! (eg. C and low level programming)

### 2: Sept 24
- tried to see how far I can get by finding some helpful videos or blogs to assist with the last bit of the filter function for pset4 and not finding quite what i'm looking for for my understanding. it also doesn't help being a friday tired mush brain and more difficult to try and understand or even know where to start. i'll take another look tomorrow for possible hints

### 1: Sept 23
- currently working through week4/pset4 - filter and spent part of the day rewatching a visual walk through of the loop to self explain the reflection loop to reverse an array; I was so stuck on the piece <code>[width - j - 1]</code> for so long, I think it finally clicked. attempted to start blur tonight, but as the most difficult of the pset, leaving it for tomorrow to break down.
