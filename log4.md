### 7: Sept 29
- started recovery problem set and noticed the programs you have to write out most all yourself seem much easier to get started, or the walkthroughs are more helpful, ha! also, bits and pieces of lecture notes code help get started on this one as well

### 6: Sept 28
- wrote out the last bit of the blur function explanation, some bits still kind of missing but will circle back, I got most of it...onto 'recover,' hopefully a tiny bit easier 😅

### 5: Sept 27
- no real code work but some prep for a meeting the next day that was rescheduled 🙃

### 4: Sept 26
- pretty short day since being out for most of it for once! writing out the last bit of explanations (mostly) and getting set up for the next pset, just want to be done with week 4 then struggle through week 5! :P

### 3: Sept 25
- wrote out the last bit of the functions and started writing out the walkthroughs in my notebook, stuck at blur again in that way. for these problems stuck in C, I'm more concerned with seeing how others did it and explain the basics to myself since I'm quite sure I won't be writing this type of code to start off with! (eg. C and low level programming)

### 2: Sept 24
- tried to see how far I can get by finding some helpful videos or blogs to assist with the last bit of the filter function for pset4 and not finding quite what i'm looking for for my understanding. it also doesn't help being a friday tired mush brain and more difficult to try and understand or even know where to start. i'll take another look tomorrow for possible hints


### 1: Sept 23
- currently working through week4/pset4 - filter and spent part of the day rewatching a visual walk through of the loop to self explain the reflection loop to reverse an array; I was so stuck on the piece <code>[width - j - 1]</code> for so long, I think it finally clicked. attempted to start blur tonight, but as the most difficult of the pset, leaving it for tomorrow to break down.
