## 1: Sept 23
- currently working through week4/pset4 - filter and spent part of the day rewatching a visual walk through of the loop to self explain the reflection loop to reverse an array; I was so stuck on the piece <code>[width - j - 1]</code> for so long, I think it finally clicked. attempted to start blur tonight, but as the most difficult of the pset, leaving it for tomorrow to break down.
