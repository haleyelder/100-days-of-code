# 100 Days of Code
Inspired by <a href="https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code" target="_blank"> Kallaway's 100 Days of Code</a> numerous Campers followed at the beginning of this year, I know there is usually a dip in learning/teaching in the summer. This will serve as a tracker for work completed, staying on track, and working on more projects!
