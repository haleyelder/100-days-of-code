# 100 Days of Code
Inspired by <a href="https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code" target="_blank"> Kallaway's 100 Days of Code</a> and other numerous Campers following suit at the beginning of this year, I recognized the usual dip in learning/teaching to code in the summer. This repo serves as a mini daily blog of what I did and pros/cons of that day. Each day will receive a corresponding <a href="https://twitter.com/haleyelder" target="_blank">tweet</a> to stay accountable.

Stay tuned and follow my progress in the<a href="https://github.com/haleyelder/100-days-of-code/blob/master/log.md">LOG</a>
