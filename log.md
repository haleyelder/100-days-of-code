# 100 Days of Code Log

## Day 3 : June 3, 2017

- Worked through converting the static site to WP and it's working on localhost! Theme has been activated and all looks good so far, just need to finalize some function and styling before handing off.

- pro / con: might've been more coding experience or other tutorials but the install for adding the theme was pretty simple! Was just put off that the styles and javascript had to be in the root folder but I'm sure there's a different kind of php link for that

## Day 2 : June 2, 2017

- Converting a simple Boostrap template to mimic the design for an old site to be converted to WP (see day 1 :P); final touches when converted over and working properly

- pro : having a design already up in code made it easier, not sure about some artistic touches made along the way but hey it's a start


## Day 1 : June 1, 2017

- Some scouring the web for a "convert HTML to WordPress" tutorial to work on this weekend, original plans for a site fell through and going the WP route. Also found a Bootstrap template to build from and convert over. 

- pro/con : been years since I've done anything with WP, but would like to get this project completed and ready to go live sooner than later!
