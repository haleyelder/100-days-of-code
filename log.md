# 100 Days of Code Log

### Day 6 : June 6, 2017

- Did more WP site troubleshooting more than starting my calculator, kinda felt in a brain fog and not sure how to start. Questioning my route in Front End Dev for the 239802th time, it happens

- pro / con: Found the missing closed div and such for WP site! only took sifting through 4 files to find/fix it... 

### Day 5 : June 5, 2017

- Another day complete for JS30, and setting up the frame for the Calculator challenge for Free Code Camp, which will be continued at tomorrow's meetup!

- pro / con: I know I jump around to different projects, but I have so many it's easy to return to them, but I'm driven to finish ONE thing if it's a cert, all JS30 days or an online course. 

### Day 4 : June 4, 2017

- Spent a good chunk of yesterday coding for WordPress so just did Array Cardio 2 as part of <a href="https://javascript30.com/" target="_blank">Javscript 30</a>. 

- pro / con: I enjoy learning more useful little projects from JS30 but it's hard for me to come back and stick with going through each of em. But being so bite sized projects/videos makes them easier, keep on keepin on!

### Day 3 : June 3, 2017

- Worked through converting the static site to WP and it's working on localhost! Theme has been activated and all looks good so far, just need to finalize some function and styling before handing off.

- pro / con: might've been more coding experience or other tutorials but the install for adding the theme was pretty simple! Was just put off that the styles and javascript had to be in the root folder but I'm sure there's a different kind of php link for that

### Day 2 : June 2, 2017

- Converting a simple Boostrap template to mimic the design for an old site to be converted to WP (see day 1 :P); final touches when converted over and working properly

- pro : having a design already up in code made it easier, not sure about some artistic touches made along the way but hey it's a start


### Day 1 : June 1, 2017

- Some scouring the web for a "convert HTML to WordPress" tutorial to work on this weekend, original plans for a site fell through and going the WP route. Also found a Bootstrap template to build from and convert over. 

- pro/con : been years since I've done anything with WP, but would like to get this project completed and ready to go live sooner than later!
