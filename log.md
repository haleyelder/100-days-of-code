# 100 Days of Code Log

### Day 14 : June 14, 2017

- Domain has been purchased for WP site, frantically finishing up some loose ends, I'm thinking Sunday might be the finalizing day if I don't get to it tomorrow. 

- pro / con : overstressing myself for the conf this week is hindering my want to work on stuff, but working day by day is alright for now. 

### Day 13 : June 13, 2017

- Searching, searching, searching, spinning some wheels again but I think I have a good foothold for tomorrow to start something! I think more of a break day again.

- pro / con : kinda set up for tomorrow to start a walkthrough, but I feel like I do this too often and spin my wheels... 

### Day 12 : June 12, 2017

- Another break from coding but for good reason! Local Women Who Code chapter celebrated 3 years! As part of the extended/volunteer team, I had to be in front of a 100 or so people, nervewracking!

- pro : seeing old and new faces! our chapter has grown so much even since I started about 1.5 years ago. 

### Day 11 : June 11, 2017

- Finalized the calc tutoarial and started refactoring from jQuery to vanilla javascript. Looking back for MERN tutorials and found one an old one to work through. 

- pro / con: Still on my "I need focus trip," but more searching for fullstack React (MERN) would help I think. Put your nose to the grindstone!

### Day 10 : June 10, 2017

- Continued on some more Udacity work on closures, still confused for now. Also working through a JS calculator tutorial to work through FCC projects

- pro / con: Still feel like I'm jumping around a lot for learning and even project ideas, I think I confuse myself too much. Hard to focus on one thing sometimes :\

### Day 9 : June 9, 2017

- Purchased <a href="http://portland.act-w.org/" target="_blank">ACT-W tickets</a> for the conference next week and prepping my website to be shown off! Probably will need a couple business cards ;)

- pro / con: It's been overdue for some updates on the site...still seems behind to me, but there isn't much I have to show right now really. Hope to change that soon.

### Day 8 : June 8, 2017

- No time to log today, was celebrating and enjoying my birthday :)

- pros: This is why I have been additionally saving a time log of previous days that can "cover" for days like this

### Day 7 : June 7, 2017

- Created an account for Udacity to work through the free course sections as part of the Nanodegrees, I can also skip things that I already feel I've got a good handle on. Already went through the Scopes videos tonight!

- pro / con: Hopefully this doesnt go over my head too quick or lack of applying the course material...but the bite sized videos are sure nice

### Day 6 : June 6, 2017

- Did more WP site troubleshooting more than starting my calculator, kinda felt in a brain fog and not sure how to start. Questioning my route in Front End Dev for the 239802th time, it happens

- pro / con: Found the missing closed div and such for WP site! only took sifting through 4 files to find/fix it... 

### Day 5 : June 5, 2017

- Another day complete for JS30, and setting up the frame for the Calculator challenge for Free Code Camp, which will be continued at tomorrow's meetup!

- pro / con: I know I jump around to different projects, but I have so many it's easy to return to them, but I'm driven to finish ONE thing if it's a cert, all JS30 days or an online course. 

### Day 4 : June 4, 2017

- Spent a good chunk of yesterday coding for WordPress so just did Array Cardio 2 as part of <a href="https://javascript30.com/" target="_blank">Javscript 30</a>. 

- pro / con: I enjoy learning more useful little projects from JS30 but it's hard for me to come back and stick with going through each of em. But being so bite sized projects/videos makes them easier, keep on keepin on!

### Day 3 : June 3, 2017

- Worked through converting the static site to WP and it's working on localhost! Theme has been activated and all looks good so far, just need to finalize some function and styling before handing off.

- pro / con: might've been more coding experience or other tutorials but the install for adding the theme was pretty simple! Was just put off that the styles and javascript had to be in the root folder but I'm sure there's a different kind of php link for that

### Day 2 : June 2, 2017

- Converting a simple Boostrap template to mimic the design for an old site to be converted to WP (see day 1 :P); final touches when converted over and working properly

- pro : having a design already up in code made it easier, not sure about some artistic touches made along the way but hey it's a start


### Day 1 : June 1, 2017

- Some scouring the web for a "convert HTML to WordPress" tutorial to work on this weekend, original plans for a site fell through and going the WP route. Also found a Bootstrap template to build from and convert over. 

- pro/con : been years since I've done anything with WP, but would like to get this project completed and ready to go live sooner than later!
