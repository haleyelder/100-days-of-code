# 100 Days of Code Log

## Day 1 : June 1, 2017

- Some scouring the web for a "convert HTML to WordPress" tutorial to work on this weekend, original plans for a site fell through and going the WP route. Also found a Bootstrap template to build from and convert over. 

- pro/con : been years since I've done anything with WP, but would like to get this project completed and ready to go live sooner than later!
